# Frontegg Provider

The Frontegg provider provides resources to interact with the [Frontegg] user
management platform.

The provider works with only one workspace at a time. To provision multiple
workspaces, you will need to configure multiple copies of the provider.

Note that the client ID and secret key are *not* the client ID and secret key
that appear in "Workspace Settings". You need to generate a workspace API key
and secret specifically for the Terraform provider's use in the administration
portal:

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "frontegg" {
  client_id = "e295e71d-40b3-4178-b0de-f7a1f3818ea4"
  email     = "bot@company.com"
  password  = "sekret"
}
```
