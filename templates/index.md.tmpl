# Frontegg Provider

The Frontegg provider provides resources to interact with the [Frontegg] user
management platform.

It is not recommended to use your own account for management of your Frontegg
workspace. A user specific to Terraform is recommended. You can find the client
ID by navigating to the "Workspace Settings" screen and locating the "Client ID"
field in the "API Key" section.

The provider works with only one workspace at a time. To provision multiple
workspaces, you will need to configure multiple copies of the provider.

## Example Usage
